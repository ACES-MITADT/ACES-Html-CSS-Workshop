# ACES-Html-CSS-Workshop

ACES is an autonomous student body under the Computer Science and Engineering Department of MIT School of Engineering, [MIT ADT University](https://www.mituniversity.edu.in/).

Here at ACES, our goal is to provide opportunities to all future Computer Science Engineers to delve much deeper into their passions & interests â€“ technical & cultural, and build a strong camaraderie with not only their peers but also the faculty of this department!

We want every student in the department to be able to establish themselves as a great individual outside the classroom, and ACES promises to be a helpful guide during the journey!
