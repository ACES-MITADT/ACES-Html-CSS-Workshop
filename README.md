# ACES-Html-CSS-Workshop

ACES is an autonomous student body under the CSE Department of MIT School of Engineering, MIT ADT University.

Here at ACES, our goal is to provide opportunities to all future Computer Science Engineers to delve much deeper into their passions & interests â€“ technical & cultural, and build a strong camaraderie with not only their peers but also the faculty of this department!

We want every student in the department to be able to establish themselves as a great individual outside the classroom, and ACES promises to be a helpful guide during the journey!

HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.
